# AndroidRoomTodoList
we are going to be creating a ToDo Listing application using the Android Architecture Components.

#### Why Room

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. The library helps you create a cache of your app's data on a device that's running your app. This cache, which serves as your app's single source of truth, allows users to view a consistent copy of key information within your app, regardless of whether users have an Internet connection.
